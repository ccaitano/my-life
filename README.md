# MyLife

## Overview
MyLife is a lifestyle application that sends reminders to a user based on the tasks they have set in the settings. These tasks can be anything from drinking 8 glasses of water a day to having your medications. Unlike other apps the reminders will be broken up into small manageable tasks from your initial large tasks. For example if a user wants to drink 8 glasses of water, from the sleep schedule of the person there would be 16 hours in a day. Since the user specifies in the settings that they donâ€™t want any notifications after 10, if they wake up at 6, they will get a notification every 2 hours to drink a glass of water. This can also be done for eating food, medications, any any other tasks they input. 

Note: the reminders would be specific to the task. Other functionality includes collaborators, tracking of progress, styling, and enviornmental notificaitons.
